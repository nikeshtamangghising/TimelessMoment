# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements paginated lazy loading for product listings to improve performance and user experience. Instead of loading all products at once, the system will load products in batches of 12, fetching additional batches as the user scrolls to the end of the current list. This approach reduces initial load times, minimizes database queries, and provides a smooth browsing experience while clearly indicating when all products have been loaded.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user browsing products, I want the page to load quickly with an initial set of products, so that I can start viewing products immediately without waiting for the entire catalog to load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a product listing page THEN the system SHALL load exactly 12 products initially
2. WHEN the initial products are loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN the initial 12 products are loaded THEN the system SHALL display them in the product grid
4. IF there are fewer than 12 products total THEN the system SHALL load all available products

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who has viewed the initial products, I want to see more products when I scroll to the bottom, so that I can continue browsing without manual pagination controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls to within 200px of the bottom of the product list THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger loading of the next 12 products
2. WHEN additional products are being loaded THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator at the bottom of the list
3. WHEN new products are loaded THEN the system SHALL append them to the existing product grid seamlessly
4. WHEN loading fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide a retry option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who has loaded all available products, I want to know when there are no more products to load, so that I understand I've seen the complete catalog.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all products from the database have been loaded THEN the system SHALL display "No more products to load" message
2. WHEN the end message is displayed THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger any additional loading attempts
3. WHEN there are no products at all THEN the system SHALL display "No products found" message
4. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL reset to loading the first 12 products

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user browsing on different devices, I want the lazy loading to work consistently across desktop and mobile, so that I have a smooth experience regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL detect scroll position accurately
2. WHEN a user scrolls on desktop THEN the system SHALL detect scroll position accurately
3. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper scroll detection
4. WHEN products are loading THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate requests from multiple scroll events

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with a slow internet connection, I want to see clear loading states and error handling, so that I understand what's happening and can retry if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN products are loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loaders or spinner indicators
2. WHEN a network request fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a "Try Again" button
4. WHEN the user clicks "Try Again" THEN the system SHALL retry loading the failed batch
5. WHEN loading takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL show a timeout message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the lazy loading to work with existing filters and sorting, so that users can still use all product browsing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL reset to page 1 and load the first 12 filtered products
2. WHEN a user changes sorting THEN the system SHALL reset to page 1 and load the first 12 sorted products
3. WHEN filters or sorting change THEN the system SHALL clear previously loaded products
4. WHEN lazy loading with filters THEN the system SHALL maintain the filter parameters in subsequent requests
