# Button Text Consistency Fix

## Issue Identified
The product cards showed different button text in different sections:
- **Homepage**: Short text ("Add", "Buy") - using `compact={true}`
- **Product Details "You May Also Like"**: Full text ("Add to Cart", "Buy Now") - using default mode

## Solution Applied

### Updated Recommended Products Component
Added `compact={true}` prop to ProductCard in the "You May Also Like" section:

```tsx
// Before
<ProductCard
  product={product as any}
  trackViews={false}
  onProductClick={() => {
    window.location.href = `/products/${product.slug}`
  }}
/>

// After  
<ProductCard
  product={product as any}
  trackViews={false}
  compact={true}  // ← Added this line
  onProductClick={() => {
    window.location.href = `/products/${product.slug}`
  }}
/>
```

## Button Text Comparison

### Before Fix
| Section | Add Button | Buy Button |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Homepage | 🛒 Add | ⚡ Buy |
| Product Details | 🛒 Add to Cart | ⚡ Buy Now |

### After Fix  
| Section | Add Button | Buy Button |
|---------|------------|------------|
| Homepage | 🛒 Add | ⚡ Buy |
| Product Details | 🛒 Add | ⚡ Buy |

## Benefits

### Visual Consistency
- **Uniform Button Text**: Same short, clean button labels across all sections
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Shorter text works better on smaller screens
- **Consistent Spacing**: Compact mode provides better spacing in recommendation grids

### User Experience
- **Familiar Interface**: Users see the same button style everywhere
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Consistent labeling reduces confusion
- **Better Scanning**: Shorter text is easier to scan quickly

### Design Harmony
- **Unified Design Language**: Consistent compact styling throughout
- **Better Grid Layout**: Compact cards work better in dense grids
- **Improved Readability**: Less text clutter in recommendation sections

## Compact Mode Features

When `compact={true}` is used, ProductCard automatically:
- Uses shorter button text ("Add" vs "Add to Cart")
- Applies smaller padding and margins
- Uses smaller font sizes for better density
- Maintains all functionality while saving space

## Files Modified
- `src/components/products/recommended-products.tsx` - Added `compact={true}` prop

The "You May Also Like" section now perfectly matches the homepage product card styling with consistent, clean button text!
