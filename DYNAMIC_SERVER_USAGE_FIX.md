# DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing `DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE` errors on the `/products/[slug]` page during server-side rendering. This error occurs when Next.js server components try to access dynamic APIs (like `cookies()`, `headers()`, or `searchParams`) during static generation.

## Error Details
```
[Error: An error occurred in the Server Components render. The specific message is omitted in production builds to avoid leaking sensitive details. A digest property is included on this error instance which may provide additional details about the nature of the error.] {
  digest: 'DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE',
  page: '/products/smart-home-speaker'
}
```

## Root Cause
1. **Cache System Headers**: The cache middleware was setting response headers during server-side rendering
2. **View Count Increment**: The synchronous view count increment was causing potential dynamic API access
3. **Static Generation vs Dynamic Rendering**: The page was trying to be statically generated but needed dynamic capabilities

## Solution Applied

### 1. Force Dynamic Rendering
**File**: `src/app/products/[slug]/page.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
// Enable ISR with 1 hour revalidation
export const revalidate = 3600
```

To:
```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering to avoid DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE errors
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
```

### 2. Non-blocking View Count
**File**: `src/app/products/[slug]/page.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
// Increment view count (best-effort)
try {
  await productRepository.incrementViewCount(product.id)
} catch (e) {
}
```

To:
```typescript
// Increment view count (best-effort, non-blocking)
productRepository.incrementViewCount(product.id).catch(() => {
  // Ignore errors - view count is not critical
})
```

### 3. Conditional Cache Headers
**File**: `src/lib/cache.ts`

Updated cache middleware to only set headers in production:
```typescript
// Add cache headers only in production
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  response.headers.set('X-Cache', 'MISS')
  response.headers.set('Cache-Control', `public, max-age=${ttl}, s-maxage=${ttl}`)
}
```

## Result
- ✅ Build successful with no errors
- ✅ Product pages now render as dynamic routes (`ƒ`) instead of causing errors
- ✅ Development server starts without DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE errors
- ✅ All functionality preserved while fixing the rendering issue

## Trade-offs
- **Performance**: Product pages are now dynamically rendered instead of statically generated, which may be slightly slower but ensures proper functionality
- **Caching**: View count increments are now non-blocking, preventing them from blocking page rendering
- **Headers**: Cache debugging headers are only added in production to avoid development issues

## Future Optimizations
For better performance in production, consider:
1. Re-enabling ISR with proper dynamic API handling
2. Implementing client-side view count tracking
3. Using edge functions for cache operations
