# Product Card Icon Cleanup Fix

## Issue Identified
The product card buttons had duplicate icons - both SVG icons and emojis were being displayed, creating visual clutter.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Duplicate SVG Icons
**Before:**
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center justify-center">
  <svg className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M3 3h2l.4 2M7 13h10l4-8H5.4m0 0L7 13m0 0l-2.5 5M7 13v6a1 1 0 001 1h9a1 1 0 001-1v-6M9 9h6m-3-3v6" />
  </svg>
  🛒 Add to Cart
</div>
```

**After:**
```tsx
🛒 Add to Cart
```

### 2. Simplified Button Content
- **Add to Cart Button**: Now shows only `🛒 Add to Cart` (or `🛒 Add` in compact mode)
- **Buy Now Button**: Now shows only `⚡ Buy Now` (or `⚡ Buy` in compact mode)  
- **Sold Out State**: Now shows only `❌ Sold Out`

### 3. Cleaned Up Imports
- Removed unused `Link` import
- Removed unused `getCurrencySymbol` import
