# Mobile Recommended Products Optimization

## Problem Fixed
The "You May Also Like" section on product detail pages was showing product cards that took full screen width on mobile devices, making them too large and reducing the number of visible products.

## Solution Implemented

### ðŸ”§ Grid Layout Changes
**Before:**
```tsx
// Only 1 column on mobile - cards took full width
grid-cols-1 xs:grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5 2xl:grid-cols-6 gap-4 sm:gap-6
```

**After:**
```tsx
// 2 columns on mobile - more compact and user-friendly
grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-4 xl:grid-cols-5 2xl:grid-cols-6 gap-3 sm:gap-6
```

### ðŸ“± Mobile-Optimized Badge System
**Enhanced recommendation badges for mobile:**
- **Smaller positioning** on mobile: `top-2 left-2` vs `top-4 left-4` on desktop
- **Compact padding** on mobile: `px-1.5 py-0.5` vs `px-2.5 py-1` on desktop
- **Icon-only badges** on mobile to save space
- **Full text badges** on desktop for clarity

**Mobile Badge Display:**
- Similar: `ðŸ”—` (icon only)
- Trending: `ðŸ“ˆ` (icon only)  
- Popular: `ðŸ”¥` (icon only)
- Personalized: `âœ¨` (icon only)

**Desktop Badge Display:**
- Similar: `ðŸ”— Similar` (icon + text)
- Trending: `ðŸ“ˆ Trending` (icon + text)
- Popular: `ðŸ”¥ Popular` (icon + text)
- Personalized: `âœ¨ For You` (icon + text)

### ðŸŽ¯ Responsive Improvements

#### Mobile Layout (< 640px)
- **2 columns** of product cards
